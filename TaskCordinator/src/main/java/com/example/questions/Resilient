How can you make the system resilient to application crashes?

Store tasks in a durable database (e.g., relational databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, or NoSQL databases like MongoDB or Cassandra).
When tasks are added, persist them immediately to the database, marking their status as Pending.
Use a unique identifier for each task to avoid duplication during recovery.


How would you handle task retries in case of failure?
Use a database or distributed queue for retryable tasks to ensure they are not lost in case of a crash.
Failed tasks can be moved to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) or stored in a dedicated table for further analysis.
