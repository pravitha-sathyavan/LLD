How would you scale this system for millions of tasks?

Problem: Handling millions of tasks in memory can lead to resource exhaustion.
Solutions:
Sharding Queues:
Partition tasks into multiple queues based on some attribute (e.g., priority, task type, or hash of the task ID).
Use a consistent hashing strategy to distribute tasks evenly across queues.
Distributed Queues:
Use distributed queue systems like Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Amazon SQS to manage tasks efficiently and scale horizontally.
For priority ordering, use systems like Priority Queue in Redis or Apache Pulsar with topic partitioning.


Problem: Single-threaded or limited-thread execution won't suffice for millions of tasks.
Solutions:
Thread Pool Scaling:
Use a dynamic thread pool (ThreadPoolExecutor) with size adjustments based on workload.
Limit the maximum pool size to avoid CPU thrashing.
Task Executors:
Use ScheduledExecutorService or ForkJoinPool for parallel processing of tasks.
Assign different thread pools to different priority queues (high, medium, low).


Problem: A single node will struggle to process millions of tasks efficiently.
Solutions:
Horizontal Scaling:
Deploy the system on a cluster of servers.
Use load balancers (e.g., NGINX or HAProxy) to distribute tasks across multiple task coordinators.
