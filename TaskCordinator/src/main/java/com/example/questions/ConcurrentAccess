What happens if multiple clients try to add tasks simultaneously?

The PriorityBlockingQueue used in your code is inherently thread-safe.
It allows multiple threads to concurrently add tasks without additional synchronization.

The idCounter in your code is an AtomicInteger, which ensures atomicity.
Each increment operation (idCounter.incrementAndGet()) is thread-safe and guarantees unique task IDs without race conditions.
