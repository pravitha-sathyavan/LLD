Develop and implement a Task Coordinator system with the following requirements:

1. Task Addition: The system should allow tasks to be added with the following attributes:
	Task name
	Priority level
	Execution time

2. Task Execution: The system should execute tasks based on their priority:
	- Higher priority tasks should be executed before lower priority tasks.
	- If multiple tasks have the same priority, they should be executed in the order they were added.

3. Task Status Monitoring: The system should monitor and update the status of each task, which can be one of the following: Pending, In Progress, Completed. Task execution can be simulated by sleeping for the specified amount of time.

4. External Interaction: The system should allow external systems to submit tasks and query task status
