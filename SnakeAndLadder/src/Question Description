Design Snake & Ladder
Create a snake and ladder application. The application should take as input (from the command line or a file):

Input
Number of snakes (s) followed by s lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the head and tail positions of the snake.
Number of ladders (l) followed by l lines each containing 2 numbers denoting the start and end positions of the ladder.
Number of players (p) followed by p lines each containing a id and name.(min 2)

Output
Print all the moves in the form of the current player name followed by a random number between 1 to 6 denoting the die roll and the initial and final position based on the move.
Format: <player_name> rolled a <dice_value> and moved from <initial_position> to <final_position>
When someone wins the game, print that the player won the game.
Format: <player_name> wins the game

Assumptions
No ladder or snake at end point of another ladder or snake
No ladder with endPoint as 100
Throw the dice and whatever number the player gets, he/she moves up to that cell number.
If there is a ladder at the cell number that the player has reached he/she gets to climb the ladder and move to the next position without a dice throw.
If there is a snake at the cell number that the player has reached, he/she has to move down to the cell number where the snake ends without a dice throw.
