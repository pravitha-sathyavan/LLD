Note – If your experience is only on backend side then you can build the backend service only


Assignment Instructions:
Demonstrate the design of a stock price monitoring system.

Programming Languages
Any of Java, Python, NodeJS for backend.
Any of React, Angular for frontend.

Requirements:
Read the stock data from https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/#intraday and submit the data to the server. Pick a few available stock symbols of your choice.
The server can persist the data into a database.

Asynchronously update the stock data from source
SSO login
Highly Available
Highly scalable
Fallback in case of failure of downstream services

Areas to Keep in Mind:
The purpose of this project is to give you the opportunity to demonstrate your end-to-end development thinking, problem solving skills, and technical skills.  As you’re developing, please be mindful of the following:

Keeping razor sharp focus on performance (time and space complexity)
Using appropriate data structures/algorithms
Focus on systems design for scalability
Ensure Testing/Quality
